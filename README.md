-------

IÂ´m doing the bootcamp of Data Analytics in Ironchak. And this is my second proyect.

The objetive of this proyect is to demonstrate all i learned with Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Regex and WebScraping. For clean a database and enrich with the information i found doing the scraping. And then merge all the information and analyze it.

`First step,` I downloaded a DataSet from Kaggle of unemployment in Spain during 2020. paro_2020.csv

`Second step,` I created a funtion to clean the DataSet in a src/funtions_cleaning.py file. But you can check on src/data_cleaning.ipynb. 

The clean DataSet you can find on data/data_clean.csv.

`Third step,` I did scraping to get information that could enrich the DataSet. You can check on src/scraping.ipynb file.

`Forth step,` Merge the information from the DataSet and the scraping information.

`Fifth step,` I imported the new DataSet to explain my hypothesis with graphics.

`My hypothesis: `

See the situation of unemployment after confinement due to COVID in Spain.(Confinement 15 mar 2020 - 21 jun 2020)

So, I cheched the total unemployment by comunities and the unemployment by sectors and comunities during July. To see which one was most affected
